# perspectives-of-the-perplexed

This repository contains miscellaneous notes, with some
supporting code, on math, science, or whatever amuses me.

As far as I, Michael Albert, am concerned, this is
all public domain.  I will try to cite sources as
appropriate, but no guarantees.

Feel free to copy this and use it as you would like. 
My apologies, but I am unlikely to respond to pull
requests or other communications in a timely manner.
